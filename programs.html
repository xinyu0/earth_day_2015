		Marking the 45th anniversary of Earth Day, Global Citizen 2015 Earth Day comes during a pivotal time to protect the planet and ensure that world leaders address key issues facing the next generation. Timed to coincide with the spring meetings of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund, Global Citizen 2015 Earth Day will bring together global policymakers, finance ministers, environment and development NGOs, industry executives and high-profile artists.

Together, these world leaders will work to educate and inspire citizens to take immediate action to end extreme poverty and address climate change. The event is part of a widespread effort to mobilize global citizens in the climate and environmental movement, and the poverty and development movement to drive bold commitments from governments, businesses and individuals.

			</ul>
	</h2>

	<p>Earth Day Network and Union Station are proud to present Earth Day at Union Station, two days of events at America’s busiest transportation hub on Tuesday April 21 and Wednesday April 22, marking the 45th anniversary of Earth Day on Tuesday, April 22.

About Union Station

Union Station is the third most visited tourist attraction in the world, just behind Times Square and Central Park. Each year, Union Station hosts more visitors than Disney World in Orlando FL and Disney Land in Anaheim CA combined!

Earth Day and Earth Day Network:

Earth Day, observed by over 1 billion people, is the only event celebrated simultaneously around the globe by people of all backgrounds, faiths and nationalities.

The first Earth Day, on April 22, 1970, activated 20 million Americans from all walks of life and is widely credited with launching the modern environmental movement. The passage of the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act and establishment of the EPA soon followed. Growing out of the first Earth Day, Earth Day Network (EDN) works with over 22,000 partners in 192 countries to broaden, diversify and mobilize the environmental movement. More than 1 billion people now participate in Earth Day activities each year, making it the largest civic observance in the world.</p>
