			IT’S OUR TURN TO LEAD.
		</h2>
		
		<div class="col6ab">
		<p>
			The theme of Earth Day 2015 is It’s Our Turn to Lead. This Earth Day Network campaign seeks to harness the power of Earth Day to pressure world leaders to recognize the massive challenge that climate change presents, while uniting people around the globe in a powerful call to action. 
			<br>
		</p>

	<p>

		2015 could be the most exciting year in environmental history. The year in which economic growth and sustainability join hands. The year in which world leaders finally pass a binding climate change treaty. The year in which citizens and organizations divest from fossil fuels and put their money into renewable energy solutions. These are tough issues but we know what’s at stake is the future of our planet and the survival of life on earth. On Earth Day we need you to take a stand so that together, we can show the world a new direction. It’s our turn to lead. So our world leaders can follow by example.In just 45 years, Earth Day Network has accumulated over one billion people in 192 countries to come together to help protect our natural world.<br><br>

	<span>Now It’s Our Turn to Lead. Join The Movement. Take Action.</span></p></div>

			WHAT IS #EARTH DAY#?
		</h2>
		<div class="col8a">	
			<p>For 45 years, Earth Day has been bringing communities and organizations together to advocate for a healthier environment and a sustainable life.
			<br>The first Earth Day on April 22, 1970 activated 20 million Americans from all walks of life to share their concerns about each citizen’s critical role in the environment.
			<br>Their actions led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the passage of the Clean Air, Clean Water, and Endangered Species Acts.
			<br>Now over one billion people in 192 countries participate in Earth Day activities, making it the largest civic observance in the world.
			<br>Today, people everywhere are experiencing first-hand the devastating consequences of countries polluting their way to the top.
			<br>Populations worldwide are in immediate danger, making it more urgent to act than ever before. We must come together and inspire our communities to do their part in securing a healthy and sustainable future for the planet. Organizing an Earth Day event or activity is one of the best ways to engage your community to protect the planet.

	<h2>
	WHY IT MATTERS?
	</h2>
	<br>
	<h3>Sustainable Development</h3><br>
<p>One billion people still live on less than $1.25 per day. One of the biggest controversies over a treaty has been the issue that developing countries don’t want to give up economic growth no matter the environmental cost, since the US and other developed countries got to pollute their way to the top.
Those most affected by climate change are low-income or marginalized populations. The Pacific Island nation of Kiribati, for example - one of the poorest places on Earth — was the first country to declare its land uninhabitable due to sea level rise from climate change, and has asked for help in evacuating its population. Even more people will fall into poverty and food will become more scarce if we don’t stop our misuse of the plane.

Eradicating global poverty is possible, but only in a world where all countries commit to a low carbon future. We’ve got the technology. All we need is the will. Sustainability can be the answer to development, the only answer.

<h3>Grassroots Making a Difference</h3><br>
<p>Over 400,000 people came together this past September in NYC for the biggest climate march of all time. Their call for action from the city streets reverberated around the world. They rallied for their leaders to recognize the catastrophic implications of climate change.

Their call did not fall on deaf ears. As Obama said in his speech at the NYC Climate Summit that week, “We cannot pretend we cannot hear them. We must answer their call.” Let’s make 2015 the year when our world leaders pay attention and answer our call.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Time for a Treaty</h3><br>
<p>Over the past 20 years, there have been a series of failed attempts to create an effective international treaty on climate change mitigation. In 1997, the first major international agreement was passed, The Kyoto Protocol. The US—one of the top polluters—didn’t ratify. Since then, many Summits and many efforts to come to agreement—Rio, Copenhagen—have ended in a flop. (see more)- But Paris must be it! Governmental, business, and non-profit leaders must come to an agreement that will cut our emissions and limit our warming to 2°C.

Let’s make 2015 the year when our leaders pass a historic binding, global climate treaty.</p></div>
