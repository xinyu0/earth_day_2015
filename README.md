# Earth Day 2015 Redesign

This is the project that I worked on during the UI design class at the Iron Yard.

Please check out [the current site](http://www.earthday.org/2015), [the redesign] (http://xinyudesign.com/earth_day_2015/), and [the redesign styleguide](http://xinyudesign.com/earth_day_2015_styleguide/) here.

So the idea behind the Earth Day 2015 site is to get more people, especially the younger generation, to talk about Earth Day, and get them involved by giving immediate resources that they can act upon such as local event info and leadership guides. 

My goal for the redesign is to make the site super easy to navigate through, get people, especially the younger crowd, excited about Earth Day, and start to think being part of this campaign is fun and interesting.
