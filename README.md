# Earth Day 2015 Redesign

This is the project that I worked on during the UI design class that I took at the Iron Yard.

Please also check out [the current site](http://www.earthday.org/2015), [the redesign] (http://xinyudesign.com/earth_day_2015/), and [the redesign styleguide](http://xinyudesign.com/earth_day_2015_styleguide/).

Earth Day is probably the most well-known civic observance in the world. Earth Day Network (EDN) is an organization that educates the public about climate change and the importance of sustainability. With its 45th anniversary coming up this month, they have launched its 2015 campaign website themed “It’s Our Turn to Lead.” The idea behind the site is to get more people, especially the younger generation, to talk about Earth Day, and get them involved by giving immediate resources that they can act upon such as local event info and leadership guides. 

Despite its influence, the original site was very basic, something that provided Earth Day 2015 with a web presence and not much more. The site is very difficult to navigate, and it's very confusing to the users as what actions to take.

###Goals for the redesign

For the redesign, I wanted to make the site super easy to navigate through, get people, especially the younger crowd, excited about Earth Day, and start to think being part of this campaign is fun and interesting.

1. Make the site more appealing to its younger audience.
2. Use context to compel users to action.
3. Keep the content clear and concise from beginning to end.
4. Improve UI’s to make things be more consistent.
